# -Appointment-Planner
Appointment Planner from Codecademy: React app
In this project, i will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: 
one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.
How to use: Make sure you have Node installed on your computer and then, inside the projectâ€™s root directory, run npm install. Finally, run npm start which will automatically open up a new tab in your browser with your running application. If a new tab does not appear, you can visit http://localhost:3000/.
